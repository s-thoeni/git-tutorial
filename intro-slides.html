# GIT introduction

---

# What is GIT? 

**Version Control System (VCS)** for tracking changes in files
- Distributed

- Coordinates work between multiple developers

- Who made what changes and when

- Jump back to any point at any time

- Local & remote repos

---

# Repositories (Repo's)

- A repo is a container for a project you want to track with git. e.g WSG https://github.hpe.com/scs/wsg or this slideset https://github.com/s-thoeni/git-tutorial

- Can have many different repos for many different projects on you computer

- Like a project folder which GIT tracks the contents

# File states (Workflow)
.row[
.column-3[
**Modified**
- Changed files
- Not commited
]
.column-3[
**Staged**
- All changed files that you want to commit
]
.column-3[
**Commited**
- All files included in the 'snapshot'
- All files from the staging are will be commited
- Commited files are 'unmodified' files

# In action
Please fix the typo in this line of text and track the change in git.

```
$ git status                  # shows the modification of the file
$ git diff                    # shows the excact modification of the file
$ git add intro-slides.html   # adds the file to the staging area
$ git commit -m 'fixing typo' # commits the file
$ git status                  # no more untracked files
```

We can see the change in our log:
```
$ git log --graph --oneline --all
```
---

# Reverting changes
Make some change that doesn't make sense and then revert the change:

```
$ git commit -m 'some bad commit' # commits the file
$ git status                      # no more untracked files
$ git log                         # to find the bad commit
$ git revert _hash_               # to revert the change
$ git commit                      # to commit the revert
```

Interesting observation in the log now:
```
$ git log --graph --oneline --all
```

# Branches
Branches allow us to have multiple lines of development for our repo. Branches are the single most usefull tool of git. They allow us to develop multiple software versions at the same time (20.09 and 20.10).

Branches also allow us to develop features independent from a release thus enabling true agile development.

You always commit on some branch (e.g. 'master' branch)

# Merging
Merging is the process of joining two development histories together.

Apply all commits from one branch onto the other and incorporate this in a 'merge commit'
![](merge.PNG)

---
# In Action
Create a branch, fix the typo, merge the fix.

```
$ git branch fix-typo                  # creates the branch
$ git checkout fix-typo                # checkout the branch
$ git add intro-slides.html            # stage intro-slides
$ git commit -m 'fixing typo'          # commit the change
$ git checkout feat/branching-slides   # to revert the change
$ git merge fix-typo                   # to commit the revert
``` 

observe the log
```
$ git log --graph --oneline --all
```

# The one we all hate - Conflicts
When the same line of code is changed on two branches its impossible to merge the two.

The only method of resolving such a conflict is by manually fixing it.

Merge the branch 'feat/branching-slides' into master. What is causing the conflict? How do we solve it?

---
# Local/Remote
Right now we were only working on the local repo. Working with a remote is simple:

```
$ git pull      # pulls the changes from remote and merges if it has to
$ git push      # pushes local changes to remote
```
