# GIT introduction

---

# What is GIT? 

**Version Control System (VCS)** for tracking changes in files
- Distributed

- Coordinates work between multiple developers

- Who made what changes and when

- Jump back to any point at any time

- Local & remote repos

---

# Repositories (Repo's)

- A repo is a container for a project you want to track with git. e.g WSG https://github.hpe.com/scs/wsg or this slideset https://github.com/s-thoeni/git-tutorial

- Can have many different repos for many different projects on you computer

- Like a project folder which GIT tracks the contents

# In action
Please fix the typo in this line of text and track the change in git.

```
$ git status                  # shows the modification of the file
$ git diff                    # shows the excact modification of the file
$ git add intro-slides.html   # adds the file to the staging area
$ git commit -m 'fixing typo' # commits the file
$ git status                  # no more untracked files
```

We can see the change in our log:
```
$ git log --graph --oneline --all
```
---

# Reverting changes
Make some change that doesn't make sense and then revert the change:

```
$ git commit -m 'some bad commit' # commits the file
$ git status                      # no more untracked files
$ git log                         # to find the bad commit
$ git revert _hash_               # to revert the change
$ git commit                      # to commit the revert
```

Interesting observation in the log now:
```
$ git log --graph --oneline --all
```
